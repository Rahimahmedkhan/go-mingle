## Start the demo

1. Install **Node.js 20 or newer** (LTS from https://nodejs.org).
2. Windows: double-click **`run-gomingle.bat`**. macOS/Linux: run `./run-gomingle.sh`.
3. The first run installs dependencies, which takes a few minutes, and the API creates its own PostgreSQL database (nothing to install: it is downloaded with the dependencies and kept in `Backend/data/`). Three server windows then open, and the browser opens both portals.

| What | URL | Sign in |
|---|---|---|
| Admin Panel | http://localhost:5173 | admin@gomingle.com / Admin@123 |
| Partner Portal | http://localhost:5174 | partner@gomingle.com / Partner@123 |
| API | http://localhost:4000 | `GET /health` |

Both sign-in screens show the account. To stop everything, close the three server windows.

**Light and dark mode:** use the moon / sun button in the top bar of either portal. Until you pick one, the portals follow your computer's setting; your choice is remembered. The GoMingle logo turns white in dark mode.

**This is a clean install.** Apart from those two accounts, the only data is a starter set in the four pick-lists, so the platform is usable from the first sign-in: **16 amenities**, **43 interests** in 8 groups, **12 topics** and **9 preference questions**. Edit or delete any of it. There are no categories, restaurants, Minglers, interest tables or bookings. The partner account starts with an empty Draft restaurant. Everything you enter is saved and survives restarts. **Data from version 0.5 and earlier is not carried over:** this version stores everything in PostgreSQL and starts fresh. Your old folder is not touched, so keep it if you need what you entered there.

**Suggested first run (about 10 minutes):**
0. **Admin Panel:** add a category (e.g. *Premium*, 12%) under **Categories**. Approval needs a category. Amenities, interests, topics and preference questions are already filled in.
1. **Partner Portal:** sign in as partner@gomingle.com, or click *Create an account*, enter any e-mail and the 6-digit code from the **GoMingle API** window (`123456` also works), then set a password.
2. Fill in the Overview (name, cuisine, address, owner, phones), upload a cover photo under *Photos & Videos* and a trade licence under *Documents*, then click **Add Payout Account**: it opens the *Payout Account* tab, where you enter the account title, bank and IBAN (for example `PK72 HABB 0012 3456 7890 1234`) and save. A yellow box on the profile lists anything still missing before *Send for Approval* turns on.
3. Click **Send for Approval**. The profile turns read-only, *Under review*.
4. **Admin Panel → Approval Queue:** the restaurant is listed and the bell shows a new notification. Open it to see the profile and documents.
5. **Decline** with a reason. The partner sees it on their profile, fixes it and resubmits.
6. **Approve** with a category. The restaurant appears under **Restaurants**, and the partner gets the full portal, the category's commission, and an "approved" notification.
7. **Partner:** add table areas with timings under *Table Timings* and menu options under *Menu Options*. They appear on the restaurant's **Schedule** and **Menu** tabs in the Admin Panel straight away.
8. **Admin → Interest Tables:** create one at the restaurant, picking a topic, one of the partner's tables and menu options. The partner sees it under *Interest Tables*.
9. **Escrow (Safepay):** in the Admin Panel open **Finances → Escrow & payouts**. Click *Sandbox booking*, pick the new restaurant and place a card hold. Then **Capture** it into escrow and **Release** it: the restaurant is paid its share minus the 10% GoMingle fee. The partner gets a notification for each step and sees the balance on **Finances**.
10. **No-show policy (Partner):** on the Restaurant Profile open the **No-Show Policy** tab (under the `…` at the end of the tabs if it does not fit) and set a penalty per empty seat, for example PKR 1,500. Zero is allowed.
11. **Book a table (Admin):** create an interest table at the restaurant whose start time is a few minutes ago (today's date, Karachi time). In **Finances → Escrow & payouts → Sandbox booking** choose the restaurant and that interest table, enter a name and seats, and place the hold. One card hold is placed **per seat**, each for the penalty amount, so three seats show as three rows. Make two bookings.
12. **Check-in (Partner):** open the interest table → **Bookings**. Use **No-show** on one booking and enter how many seats stayed empty: the holds for those seats are collected in full and the holds for the other seats are released. Then press **Guests Arrived**: the remaining bookings are checked in, their holds are released and the table is completed. The Admin Panel shows the collected penalties under **Escrow & payouts**, ready to release to the restaurant.
13. **Failed collections (Admin):** if Safepay refuses a collection or a release, it appears at the top of **Escrow & payouts** under *Failed collections* with the booking, seat, amount and Safepay's reason, and the admins get a notification. **Retry** tries it again (when it goes through, the amount is added to the booking); **Close…** closes it with a note and releases the card hold. Nothing is retried automatically.

> Steps 9 to 13 with the Safepay sandbox keys in `Backend/.env`: a sandbox booking then waits for a real card step in Safepay's checkout, so its hold stays *pending payment* and a no-show reports "Penalty not collected yet". To try the full money flow without a card, empty `SAFEPAY_API_KEY` and `SAFEPAY_SECRET_KEY` in that file and restart: the built-in simulator approves every hold.

Everything is saved under `Backend/data/`, so it survives restarts. To wipe it and start fresh, stop the servers and run `npm run reset-data` in `Backend`.

The full end-to-end test report for this release is in the project (see *GoMingle – E2E Test Report*).

## Running pieces by hand

```bash
cd Backend && npm install && npm start

cd Admin && npm ci --ignore-scripts
VITE_MSW_ENABLED=false VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/admin VITE_AUTH_MODE=api npm run dev

cd Partner && npm ci --ignore-scripts
VITE_ENABLE_MOCKS=false VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/partner VITE_AUTH_MODE=api npm run dev -- --port 5174
```

Running `npm run dev` in a portal with no variables gives a frontend-only mode for UI development: every API call is answered in the browser by Mock Service Worker using the test fixtures (sample restaurants and so on). The release runs against the API, which has no sample data.

Each portal's `.env.example` documents every variable (backend URL, auth mode, Cognito, mocks).

## Quality checks

```bash
cd Admin   && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test:run
cd Partner && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test:run
cd Backend && npm run typecheck && npm test
```

## Notes

- Backend details, configuration and current limits are in `Backend/README.md`. The main limits: no real e-mail, SMS or payments (codes print in the API window; Safepay uses the sandbox keys in `Backend/.env`; empty them to use the offline simulator), and Mingler bookings, reviews and finance figures stay empty until the Mingler app is connected.
- Production sign-in is still AWS Cognito. Set `VITE_AUTH_MODE=cognito` and the pool variables.
- The mobile app's bundle id is now `com.gomingle.customer`. Register that id in Firebase before building release apps.
- The Flutter app still pulls the Ethr UI SDK from its original Bitbucket repository. That URL in `pubspec.yaml` is the only place the old company name remains, because the package can only be fetched from where it is hosted.
