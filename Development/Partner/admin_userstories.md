## SA0 – Login

**As an** Admin or Super Admin user,
**I want to** log in with my email address and password and have a time-limited session that renews automatically while I am active,
**So that** I can access the portal securely and inactive sessions expire without manual intervention.

### Scope

**In Scope:**

- Login using email address and password
- Session establishment on successful authentication
- Role permissions loaded — navigation reflects only permitted modules
- Failed attempt tracking with lockout after 5 consecutive failures
- Automatic unlock after 15-minute lockout period
- Access token valid for 2 hours; refresh token valid for 7 days
- Silent session renewal while refresh token is valid
- Session terminated and redirect to login when both tokens expire

**Out of Scope:** Self-registration, Social or OAuth login, Multi-factor authentication

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1 – Successful login and role loading**
  - When a user submits a registered email and correct password
  - Then system authenticates, retrieves role, renders permitted navigation modules
  - And issues access token (2hr) and refresh token (7 days)

- [ ] **AC2 – Invalid credentials**
  - When a user submits unregistered email or wrong password
  - Then system displays error: "email or password is incorrect"
  - And records failed attempt with timestamp
  - And user remains on login page

- [ ] **AC3 – Account lockout after 5 failures**
  - When a user fails to log in 5 consecutive times
  - Then system locks account for 15 minutes
  - And displays lock message with remaining unlock time
  - And records lockout event with timestamp

- [ ] **AC4 – Login attempt while locked**
  - When a user attempts login while account is locked
  - Then system rejects attempt regardless of credentials
  - And displays remaining lockout duration

- [ ] **AC5 – Automatic unlock**
  - When 15 minutes have elapsed since lockout
  - Then system automatically unlocks account and resets failure counter to zero

- [ ] **AC6 – Silent session renewal**
  - When access token expires but refresh token is still valid (within 7 days)
  - Then system silently issues new access token without requiring re-login

- [ ] **AC7 – Session expiry after inactivity**
  - When both access and refresh tokens have expired
  - Then system terminates session and redirects to login page

- [ ] **AC8 – Role change reflected on next login**
  - When a user's role has been changed since their last session
  - Then system loads updated role permissions on next successful login

### Field Validation

| Field         | Required | Rule                        | Error Message             |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Email address | Yes      | Valid email format, trimmed | Email address is required |
| Password      | Yes      | Minimum 1 character         | Password is required      |

### Edge Cases

- Email with leading/trailing spaces — system trims before validation
- Deactivated account — same invalid credentials error as unregistered email
- User logged in on two devices; one refresh token expires — that device's session terminates independently

### Errors

- Email or password is incorrect
- Account is temporarily locked — try again in X minutes

## SA0.2 – Forgot Password

**As an** Admin or Super Admin user,
**I want to** reset my password by entering my registered email address and verifying a one-time code sent to that address,
**So that** I can regain access independently with protection against automated OTP abuse.

### Scope

**In Scope:**

- Password reset by entering registered email address
- 6-digit OTP sent to that email with 10-minute expiry
- OTP rate limiting: max 3 requests per email per 10-minute window
- New password complexity enforcement
- New password must differ from current password
- Password change logged with timestamp

**Out of Scope:** Password reset via SMS, Security questions

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1 – OTP sent for registered email**
  - When a user submits a registered email on the forgot password page
  - Then system sends a 6-digit numeric OTP valid for 10 minutes
  - And displays message to check inbox

- [ ] **AC2 – OTP rate limiting**
  - When a user requests 3 OTPs for the same email within any 10-minute window
  - Then system blocks further requests for 10 minutes from the third request
  - And displays message about maximum OTP requests

- [ ] **AC3 – Email address not found**
  - When a user submits an unregistered email
  - Then system displays the same confirmation message as for registered email
  - And does not generate or send any OTP

- [ ] **AC4 – Valid OTP within expiry**
  - When a user submits the correct 6-digit OTP within 10 minutes
  - Then system presents the new password entry form

- [ ] **AC5 – Incorrect OTP**
  - When a user submits an OTP that does not match
  - Then system displays error: "code is invalid"

- [ ] **AC6 – Expired OTP**
  - When a user submits the OTP after 10-minute expiry
  - Then system displays error: "code has expired"
  - And provides option to request a new OTP (subject to rate limiting)

- [ ] **AC7 – Password updated successfully**
  - When a user submits a valid new password meeting all complexity rules and differing from current
  - Then system updates password, logs change with timestamp (DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM Asia/Dubai), redirects to login

- [ ] **AC8 – Password fails requirements**
  - When a user submits a password failing any complexity rule or identical to current
  - Then system displays specific error per unmet requirement and does not update password

### Field Validation

| Field         | Required | Rule                                                    | Error Message                                       |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Email address | Yes      | Valid email format                                      | Enter a valid email address                         |
| OTP           | Yes      | Exactly 6 numeric digits                                | Enter the 6-digit code sent to your email           |
| New password  | Yes      | Min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char | Password must meet all complexity requirements      |
| New password  | Yes      | Must not match current password                         | New password must differ from your current password |

### Edge Cases

- Multiple OTPs requested before rate limit — only most recently generated code is valid
- OTP expiry measured from generation time, not email delivery time
- Browser closed mid-flow — process abandoned, must restart

### Errors

- OTP is invalid
- OTP has expired — please request a new code
- Too many OTP requests — please wait 10 minutes before trying again
- Password does not meet complexity requirements
- New password must differ from your current password

## SA4 – Categories

**As an** Admin or Super Admin user,
**I want to** create, edit and delete restaurant categories that define Commission % on Bill Amount, Minimum Commission Amount, Penalty % and Minimum Penalty Amount,

### Scope

**In Scope:**

- View all categories: name, description, Commission %, Min Commission (AED), Penalty %, Min Penalty (AED), restaurant count
- Create, edit and delete categories
- Pagination: 25 rows per page, default sort by category name ascending

- Both floor mechanisms are entirely independent of each other

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1 – Categories list with pagination**

- [ ] **AC6 – Commission and penalty floors are independent**
  - Each calculation performed independently; neither affects the other

- [ ] **AC7 – Edit a category**
  - When user modifies any field and saves
  - Then updated rules apply immediately and prospectively to all assigned restaurants
  - And change recorded in change log with old values, new values, acting user, timestamp

- [ ] **AC8 – Delete permitted when no restaurants assigned**
  - When user confirms deletion of category with zero restaurants
  - Then system removes category and records in change log

- [ ] **AC9 – Delete blocked when restaurants assigned**
  - When user attempts to delete category with assigned restaurants
  - Then system prevents deletion and displays message

- [ ] **AC10 – Validation failure**
  - Commission %: zero, negative, or non-numeric → error
  - Min Commission Amount: zero, negative, non-numeric, or decimal → error
  - Penalty %: zero, negative, or non-numeric → error
  - Min Penalty Amount: zero, negative, non-numeric, or decimal → error

- [ ] **AC11 – Duplicate category name**
  - When user submits identical name to existing category
  - Then system displays error and does not save

## SA5 – Loyalty Configuration

**As an** Admin or Super Admin user,
**I want to** configure earn rate, earn cap, redeem rate and minimum spend using whole number values with each panel saving independently,

- [ ] **AC5 – Save redeem rate**
  - When user submits valid whole numbers for both redeem rate fields
  - Then system updates redeem rate and minimum spend

**As an** Admin or Super Admin user,
**I want to** configure global defaults and per-restaurant overrides for the Auto No-Show Timer, Waiting Auto-Decline Timer and Booking Cancellation Window in the admin Settings screen,

  - When partner manually marks Approved booking as No-Show
  - Then status changes to No-Show immediately
  - And Safepay penalty capture fires when Auto No-Show Timer elapses from scheduled booking time
  - If timer already elapsed → penalty fires immediately

- [ ] **AC8 – Waiting Auto-Decline Timer fires**
  - When booking has been in Waiting status for Waiting Auto-Decline Timer duration

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1 – Notification icon present on all portal pages**
  - Notification icon visible in top-right header area on every portal page

- [ ] **AC2 – Unread badge**
  - Badge shows unread count; capped at "99+" when count exceeds 99
  - No badge when zero unread notifications

- [ ] **AC3 – Dropdown panel: 5-item preview**
  - Shows 5 most recent notifications in reverse chronological order
  - Panel header shows "Notifications" and current unread count badge
  - Each item: category icon, notification title (bold), relative timestamp (e.g. "12d ago"), description body
  - Empty state: "No notifications yet" when no notifications exist

- [ ] **AC4 – Mark all as read**
  - When user clicks Mark all as read in panel header
  - Then all notifications marked as read; badge removed; all items update to read state immediately

- [ ] **AC5 – Per-item Mark as read and visual treatment**
  - Unread: coloured left border + Mark as read link
  - Mark as read: removes border, removes link, decrements badge by one
  - Read: no border, no Mark as read link

- [ ] **AC6 – Deep-link on item click**
  - Click notification item (not Mark as read link) → navigates to relevant record
  - Restaurant notification → restaurant detail page
  - Mingler notification → Mingler profile page
  - Portal user notification → Users list filtered to that user
  - No navigable record → marks as read, no navigation

- [ ] **AC7 – View all notifications link**
  - Click "View all notifications" → closes dropdown, opens full notifications page

- [ ] **AC8 – Full notifications page: access and default state**
  - Paginated list of all notifications in reverse chronological order
  - Default: all types, no active search or filter
  - 25 per page with page navigation and total record count

- [ ] **AC9 – Full page: each row**
  - Category icon, notification title, full description body
  - Absolute timestamp (DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM Asia/Dubai UTC+4)
  - Read/unread visual state (coloured left border for unread)

- [ ] **AC10 – Full page: filter by notification type**
  - Reloads list with only selected notification type
  - Filter clearable to return to unfiltered view

- [ ] **AC11 – Full page: search by content**
  - Filters by title or description body containing search term (case-insensitive)

- [ ] **AC12 – Full page: sort**
  - Sort options: Newest first (default) or Oldest first

- [ ] **AC13 – Full page: mark as read**
  - Per-item Mark as read on full page: marks as read, updates row, decrements header badge
  - Mark all as read available on full page with same behaviour as dropdown

- [ ] **AC14 – Full page: deep-link on row click**
  - Same deep-link rules as AC6

- [ ] **AC15 – Notification retention: 90 days**
  - Notifications older than 90 days automatically purged silently

- [ ] **AC16 – Badge count consistency**
  - Unread badge count updates consistently whether user is in dropdown or on full page

- [ ] **AC17 – Client-provided: trigger list and copy templates** _(OPEN — awaiting client input)_
  - When client provides complete list of triggers, target audiences, and copy templates
  - Then system implements each trigger type accordingly
  - Title max 60 characters, Body max 160 characters — enforced at generation time

### Edge Cases

- Two sessions simultaneously — marking read in one does not update other until refresh
- New notification generated while dropdown is open — appears on next panel open or page refresh
- Role changes and user loses module access — no longer receives notifications for that module; previously received remain for 90 days
- All 5 dropdown items unread — Mark all as read clears ALL user notifications, not just visible 5
- Notification's linked record deleted — deep-link shows appropriate not-found message
- More than 99 unread — badge shows "99+"; full page shows accurate total count
- Full page zero results after filter/search → empty state: "No notifications match your filter"

### Errors

- Notification data could not be loaded — please refresh the page
- Mark as read failed — please try again
- No notifications match your filter
- No notifications yet
